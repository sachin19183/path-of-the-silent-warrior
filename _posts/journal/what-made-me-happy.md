What i loved doing effortlessly?

## Drawing
I was a shy kid who was the silent one in the class of 30 odd pupils. This behaviour echoed at my relative's place as well.
When i was in 2nd standard(around 8 years) i picked up drawing and apparently it gave me a medium to express.
I was pretty bad at it initially but over time i became decent and in 6th standard my painting on the Bomaby stock exchange
fire incident was displayed outside our principle's office. This was a big achievement.
The reason: I was very creative in drawing the fire with vibrant color combinations.

## Writing & Debating

As my confidence grew, it started reflecting in my study and marks. I was an average student and pretty much content being in top 10 (5th till 10th).
My strong suits were the language subjects especially Hindi (which also i my mother tongue) and Sanskrit. 
Boy o boy i loved these subjects and the more i studied the stories, poems, sholkas , the more i enjoyed grasping the new knowledge about different 
persepctives that i was unaware before. I loved writing long essays, interpretaions of shlokas and this became my new passion other than drawing as 
it gave another medium for me to express myself. The Teachers observed this and encouraged me further.
So my language teacher Mrs Mridula saw something in me(which i still dont know how she figured it out) and told me that she would take me to an English
debate competition. Mind you, i was not so good in English especially the speaking part as my environement was full hindi speaking with little or zero 
exposure of english speaking people. I was afraid but said yes as it meant i get to write a long speech , this time in english. In the era of no internet,
i started prepping by reading english newspapers in library, watching the English news bulletin in Doordarshan at night time to pick up the mannerisms of 
spoken english. this was all my Ridula mam asking me to follow as part of prep. She helped me writing the speech as the topics were known in advance.
It was an inter school competition. Then on the day of my first ever debate (that too in English) we went to the venue which was the biggest library in Delhi
(the Delhi public library in old delhi). There was a huge crowd in there. My speech was in favor of the topic. I went up to the podium , scared to hell inside
but not showing it outside somehow. the podium was coveredso it hid my trembling legs while i was speaking in more or less DD news tone( less expression and a monotonus tone)
just the way i rehersed it. I finished without forgetting a owrd and felt happy that i did good and have a chance of winning. Boy oh boy i was so wrong!!! 
There came my opponent, a smart girl from Delhi public school mathura road(one of the most prestigious school in delhi at that time). 
As she started her counter argument, she was pure brilliance. From the confidence to diction, expressions, everything bang on. 
Once she finished, there was a huge applause. While returning to her seat, she gave me a death stare. My confidence(whatever was left) 
was buried dep inside somewhere. This was my first taste of failure on public platform. I asked Mridula mam not to take me in any further competition 
as it was not my cup of tea. She didnt said anything at tha time. Few months passed and she came up again and aksed me to write a speech this time for someone else. 
The language was hindi and i was asked to write against the motion(as they say in debate language). I agreed happily as i was only suppose to write. 
But my teacher had other plans. During rehersals, i use to sit there and make changes in the script where i felt i have missed a point. 
Because of my interest in shlokas and other hindi literature, i added some punchlines. Mridula mam was not happy with the child who was reading the speech.
Then she asked me to read it with expression to guide the other child. As it was my speech and i had done lot of research writing it. 
I knew where to give pause, where to show agression, where to calm down. So i read it even without seeing it. There was clapping in that limited audience
and then Mridula mam said it out loud- Sachin, you will take part in the competition not as a writer but as an orator. She tricked me into it!!
As it was an intra school competion where i knew most of the participants, i felt comfortable and said yes. Later i won it as well. 
This win kickstarted my debate journey. Not only i won most of the time but i got accolades for the writing part. This was my kick or drug which gave me high.
Writing speeches and making my counter part speechless (because my preparation involved making notes on how the other one can counter or bring on the table) 
i used to write two speeches: one for the motion and one against the motion. This allowed me to change my speech on th go and majorly helped me win.

## Dancing

I loved dancing may be always. I used to copy Hero's steps when the songs came on Chitrahar. Mithun and Govinda were my favorites.
This again was one medium where i was no longer shy and simply expressed my joy. I was one of most sought after dancer during family functions and i never said no.

## Mountains and greenery

I have travlled a lot in my 10s and 20s. The trips into himalyan regions were the ones which i looked forward to. It felt as if i belonged there in the slence in the lap of nature.
I have always visualized my dream home in a valley surroundd by mountains with lush green trees, bushes and snow capped tops. In between a stream of gently flowing water psses by and 
i have a small home with few animals. That is my dream location of **MY PLACE**.
