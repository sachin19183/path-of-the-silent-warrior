## Opening Feeling

There are moments in life when the noise fades…  
and a quiet question surfaces:

“Am I walking my path… or performing someone else’s script?”

## The Conditioning

Reflect on how society defines “destination”.

## The Forgotten Compass

Introduce the idea that joy is guidance.

Questions you can explore:

- When did i stopped listening to what makes me feel alive?  
- Why is happiness treated as a side effect, not a direction?  
- Who decided struggle is more noble than joy?  

This is where the song’s emotional seed sits.

## Childhood Clues

- What i loved doing effortlessly?
  1) I was a shy kid who was the silent one in the class of 30 odd pupils. This behaviour echoed at my relative's place as well.When i was in 2nd standard(around 8 years) i picked up drawing and apparently it gave me a medium to express. i was pretty bad at it initially but over time i became decent and in 6th standard my painting on the Bomaby stock exchange fire incident was displayed outside our principle's office. This was a big achievement. The reason: I was very creative in drawing the fire with vibrant color combinations.
  2) As my confidence grew, it started reflecting in my study and marks. I was an average student and pretty much content being in top 10 (5th till 10th). My strong suits were the language subjects especially Hindi (which also i my mother tongue) and Sanskrit. Boy o boy i loved these subjects and the more i studied the stories, poems, sholkas , the more i enjoyed grasping the new knwledge about different persepctives that i was unaware before. I loved writing long essays, interpretaions of shlokas and this became my new passion other than drawing as it gave another medium for me to express myself. The Teachers observed this and encouraged me further.
  3) So my language teacher Mrs Mridula saw something in me(which i still dont know how she figured it out) and told me that she would take me to an English debate competition. Mins you, i was not so good in English especially the speaking part as my environement was full hindi speaking with little or zero exposure of english speaking people. I was afraid but said yes as it meant i get to write a long speech , this time in english. In the era of no internet, i started prepping by reading english newspapers in library, watching the English news bulletin in Doordarshan at night time to pick up the mannerisms of  spoken english. this was all my Ridula mam asking me to follow as part of prep. She helped me writing the speech as the topics were known in advance. It was an inter school competition.  Then on the day of my first ever debate (that too in English) we went to the venue which was the biggest library in Delhi (the Delhi public library in old delhi). There was a huge crowd in there. My speech was in favor of the topic. I went up to the podium , scared to hell inside but not showing it outside somehow. the podium was coveredso it hid my trembling legs while i was speaking in more or less DD news tone( less expression and a monotonus tone) just the way i rehersed it. I finished without forgetting a owrd and felt happy that i did good and have a chance of winning. Boy oh boy i was so wrong!!! There came my opponent, a smart girl from Delhi public school mathura road(one of the most prestigious school in delhi at that time). As she started her counter argument, she was pure brilliance. From the confidence to diction, expressions, everything bang on. once she finished, there was a huge applause. While returning to her seat, she gave me a death stare. My confidence(whatever was left) was buried dep inside somewhere. This was my first taste of failure on public platform. I asked Mridula mam not to take me in any further competition as it was not my cup of tea. She didnt said anything at tha time. Few months passed and she came up again and aksed me to write a speech this time for someone else. The language was hindi and i was asked to write against the motion(as they say in debate language). I agreed happily as i was only suppose dto write. But my teacher had other plans. During rehersals, i use to sit there and make changes in the script where i felt i have missed a point. Because of my interest in shlokas and other hindi literature, i added some punchlines. Mridula mam was not happy with the child who was reading the speech. Then she asked me to read it with expression to guide the other child. As it was my speech and i had done lot of research writing it. i knew where to give pause, where to show agression, where to calm down. So i read it even without seeing it. There was clapping in that limited audience and then Mridula mam siad it out loud- Sachin, you will take part in the competion not as a writer but as an orator. So very cleverly she tricked me into it. As it was an intra school competion where i knew most of the participants, i felt comfortable and said yes. Later i won it as well. This win kickstarted my debate journey. Not only i won most of the time but i got accolades for the writing part. This was my kick or drug which gave me high. Writing speeches and making my counter part speechless(because my preparation involved making notes on how the other one can counter or bring on the table) i used to write two speeches: one for the motion and one against the motion. This allowed me to change my speech on th go and majorly helped me win.
  4) I loved dancing may be always. I used to copy Hero's steps when the songs came on Chitrahar. Mithun and Govinda were my favorites. This again was one medium where i was no longer shy and simply expressed my joy. I was one of most sought after dancer during family functions and i never said no.
