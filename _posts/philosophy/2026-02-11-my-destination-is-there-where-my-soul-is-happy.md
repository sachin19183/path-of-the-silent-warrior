## The Question That Surfaces in Silence

There are moments in life when the noise fades…
and a quiet question surfaces:

> “Am I walking my path… or performing someone else’s script?”

For all those who are feeling this, I want to tell you that you are not alone. In fact, we are in the majority.

In this materialistic world, where everything has a price tag, it becomes suffocating as we move along our more or less monotonous schedules.

We feel like we are part of a never-ending race, where even a single mistake is costly.

And even though we know deep inside that this is not the right way to live, we still keep running — because apparently, most of us feel we have no other alternative.

Mostly, it is the financial responsibility of carrying our near and dear ones on our shoulders. Paying for their education, medical bills, comfort, and luxuries is what pushes us into this relentless race.

But an important thing to remember is that life is hard, often cruel, and tests us at every moment. It is a rollercoaster ride.

So how one navigates it with some sense of contentment, enjoyment, and fulfillment is what ultimately defines an individual.

Based on the Silent Warrior’s experience, here are a few pieces of advice to live through the struggles we go through.

## The Conditioning of What We Are Supposed to Do

* You should be financially well-to-do. Every individual must be at least a millionaire by the time they reach 30 (averaging the financial milestone here, as it may go up or down based on your economic background).
* You should be a role model for others around you.
* You should be a leader in your field.
* Forget enjoying life — that is for children!!
* When you are a child, forget enjoying — focus on studies.
* When you grow old and retire, then you can enjoy all you want.

This is a generic mantra given to most of us, isn’t it?

What it does is make us feel that we need to be competitive and focus only on the big picture in the future — forgetting about what we have in the present and living it a little.

Happiness and success become directly proportional to the assets we own (money, real estate, large number of followers, etc.).

## The Forgotten Compass

If you calm your mind and observe, think about this:

1. You saw an unknown person who needed a blanket to survive the cold night ahead. You happened to have that extra blanket, and you gave it. Will the gratitude in that person’s eyes make you feel happy and give you a sense of achievement?

2. When your parents fall ill and you are certain that they may not survive for long, you have the means to sidestep everything else going on in your life and spend that time with them, giving them comfort. Will that give you closure and save you from the guilt of not being there for them while being busy running after money?

3. It rained after a long, hot summer — and you were able to bathe in it, enjoying the present moment.

4. You are able to pursue your hobby in your free time — it could be painting, writing, music, dance, travelling, hiking, or playing games.

These are all basic life situations that we come across — opportunities to pause, break from the race, and truly live.

These are sources of true happiness and inner peace.

There could be many more such examples where one can derive true happiness and a sense of achievement.

## The Fear or Inner Resistance

While you are reading this, a thought would naturally arise — that all this is easier said than done.

You may have:

* Financial obligations
* Fear of instability
* Guilt in choosing yourself

And the Silent Warrior is not denying any of these. These are all real for most of us.

When we are struggling just to keep the lights on, how can anyone expect charity, self-reflection, morality, or time for hobbies?

You may be working on a company assignment abroad, carrying the financial burden for your family. Your parents’ treatment may be financed only because you are away.

All these realities are valid — and right in their own place.

> **The question is not about abandoning responsibility — but about discovering happiness even while carrying it.**

## Redefining Success

The key is to challenge the conditioning. Success is not always materialistic. Living life cannot be pushed to post-retirement, when our body may no longer feel like enjoying it.

How many of us would be fit enough then to go hiking, travel every weekend or month, or eat anything we want to?

> The Silent Warrior does not endorse the “You Live Only Once” philosophy.
> He endorses **“Understand your limitations and still find ways to live”** philosophy.

Each one has their own path. What suits one may not be suitable for another individual.

However, one thing I believe in very strongly — if we can make a positive change in someone’s life, that is success. If we can resolve conflict without bias or favoritism, that is success. If we can enjoy little moments in our present, that too is success.

We should strive to be in that position.

There is no end to greed or perfection. Knowing when to stop — or slow down — is the key.

If our moral compass points towards being human first, then I am sure we can make Earth a better place to live for all living beings.

## A Personal Realization

The Silent Warrior has also gone through a lot in life and is trying to uncondition himself to become a better human being.

Writing has been his passion since early life, and through these blogs, he is rekindling his inner voice — striving for a deeper sense of success: to make a positive difference in someone else’s life.
